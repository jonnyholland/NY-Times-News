# NY Times News
This project is designed to demonstrate using the [Composable Architecture Pattern](https://github.com/jonnyholland/ComposableArchitecturePattern) and uses the [NY Times free public API](www.developer.nytimes.com). I've made an attempt to define either fully or somewhat complex features and document the code/logic therein. The app displays a progress indicator while fetching, as well as handles any errors. There is also refresh command support app wide. Below are screenshots of it running on macOS.
